    <h2>The beginning of a journey</h2>
    <h3>28 June 2022</h3>
    <p> This is the first step of my website home page.</p>
    <p> It will eventually contain a list of links to all my blogs. </p>
    <p> The purpose of this blog is to practice my new skills and record my journey of becoming a web developer.</p>
    <p> In the process, I hope to inspire others to not be afraid of taking a new direction and getting out of your comfort zone. </p>
