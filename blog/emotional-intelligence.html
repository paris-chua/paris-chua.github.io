      <h1>Emotional Intelligence (EQ)</h1>
        <p><em>“Emotions are contagious.” Daniel Goleman</em></p>

      <h2>My research on EQ and IQ (Intelligence Quotient</h2>
        <p>Emotional intelligence or emotional quotient (EQ) is the ability to feel all emotions, 
          the emotions of others and the ability to regulate your emotions and others around you.
          The ability to assess and express the emotions of self and others. 
          As well as the regulation of these emotions are important skills to help in planning, motivate and achieve in life.
        </p>
        <p>IQ is the ability to process information visually and spatially. 
          It also represents the abilities in working and short-term memory, 
          quantitative reasoning and the capacity to think logically and solve problems in novel situations, 
          independent of previous acquired knowledge (fluid reasoning).
        </p>

        <p>Having a high EQ has shown to help in forming good relationship with others and hence perform well in leadership role. 
          It assists in better decision making, managing stress and therefore better mental well-being. 
          Culture, upbringing and innate ability could all contribute to a person's EQ. EQ could also be taught and learnt.
