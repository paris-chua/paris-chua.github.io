    <h1>CSS inline and inline-blocks display property</h1>

    <h2>What does it mean to display inline vs inline blocks?</h2>

    <p class="blue-text">This is to do with the display property in CSS. HTML elements have a default display value dependant on if the elements are inline or block level elements.
      Using CSS display property, inline elements could be presented as block elements with inline-blocks. 
      This gives the ability to adjust the width and height of inline elements. Also the padding and border without affecting the neighbouring elements.
