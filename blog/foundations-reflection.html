      <h2>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h2>
        <p class="black-text">
          It is difficult to keep your ego in a good balance and be considerate of others. 
          In terms of learning, to know your learning needs and asking for help at the appropriate time is challenging. 
          I noticed I don't give up easily, therefore tends to go over the timebox suggestions. 
          Partly because I really want to work the problem out myself, and I still find it difficult to ask for help on Discord.
          This could tip the balance over to the fixed mindset.

      <h2>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
        <p class="black-text">
          It helps to understand what your goals are, in life and in learning. It also helps in reflection. 
          In a study or work environment, it helps to cultivate positive

      <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
        <p class="black-text">
          The core material is more challenging than I realised, I do find them all very interesting. 
          I find reflection a great tool for learning and personal growth.

      <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
        <p class="black-text">
          Writing a good reflection and identity and values exploration.
        </p>

      <h2>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h2>
        <p class="black-text">
          Progamming is about problem solving. Learning core skills help in developing your mind in knowing yourself and how to interact with others.
          This is important in team work as well as individual work integrity.

      <h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h2>
        <p class="black-text">
          I personally think the core learning is important and I find it useful. Although I do feel like I could have more mentorship in the programming side.
