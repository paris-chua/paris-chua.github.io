       <h2>I was blocked on a simple problem</h2>
       <p class="black-text">
        One day, I was blocked on a simple problem, or so it seems.
        I was trying to solve the capitalize problem. I read the question carefully,
        console.logging, try to read the error messages. 
        I googled 'change first letter to upper case in string array',
        I looked up on Discord for posts with the same problem but I couldn't get to the bottom of it!
        I was feeling frustrated and getting pretty worked up. Eventually, I asked for help.

       <h2>I elegantly solved a problem</h2>
       <p class="black-text">
        On the same day, I also solved a problem a little elegantly

       <h2>Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes:</h2>
       <ol>
          <li>Pseudocode</li>
          <p class="black-text">The advice I got on the web about Pseudocode is using non-technical terms.
            Breaking down the problem into small parts, a single line of pseudocode for each parts of the problem. 
            Keep it simple but specific.
          </p>

          <li>Reading error messages</li>
          <p class="black-text">Error messages consist of the error and the stack trace. 
            The error messages are usually the part where it is useful for googling. 
            The stack trace consist of where the codes/ functions you are in on the left, and where the codes live on the right. 
            The important message I got is to learn to read the error messages would be very helpful in narrowing down what to google.
            Another tip, look for keywords, words that are not repeating often, 
            get to know phrases that are common with errors so you do not google that.
            If the message is short enough, copy and paste the whole error to google.
