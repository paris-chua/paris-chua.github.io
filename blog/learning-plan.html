        <h2>Long term goals</h2>
          <p>My long term goals are to be a better person than I was yesterday. I am always looking to learn something new.
            For the love of learning as well as personal growth. In the process, setting a good example for my children in learning, 
            as well as not being afraid of getting out of your comfort zone.
            I have never been someone who know much about technology particularly computer science. 
            I think having the knowledge of full stack web development can be useful in any career I decide to pursue.
            I would like to be in a role where I could contribute into a community, such as teaching or being a facilitator.
          </p>

        <h2>Strengths and limitations in learning</h2>
          <p>My strengths are ability to reflect and learn from mistakes, problem-solving skills, analytic skills, team work, determination and perseverance.
            Skills I am trying to improve are describing, creative thinking, not overly self critical and adopting the "not yet" attitude. 
          </p>
          
        <h2>Core human skills</h2>
          <p>I would like to develop my public speaking skills, listening with intention and be more observance and present. 
          </p>

        <h2>Commitment in the programme</h2>
          <p>I have readjust my commitments outside of the programme to fit around the course. I am committed so I will take the time required to reach my goals.
            I have plan to do this by setting daily goals. Reflect and revise my goals at the end of the day. 
            Taking daily frequent short break and plan for a long break. 
            Plan for something social and relaxing at the end of the week as an incentive and to celebrate. Mentorship with at least 2 people. 
            Referring back to the process and framework of programming problem solving document until it is a habit and the learning objectives at least three times a day. 
            Getting comfortable in asking for help from facilitation team and other learners before the pressure builds up.
          </p>

        <h2>My expectations from the facilitation team</h2>
          <p>
            Be present, kind, individualised help, checking in and feedback.
