      <h1>My Web Development Learning Plaaaannnnnnnn</h1>
      <em>can you hear me shouting it!</em>
      <em id="see-red">I am over this color!</em>

        <h2>Long term goals</h2>
          <p class="black-text">
            I am very lucky to be having this oppurtunity to learn something new. 
            For the love of learning as well as personal growth.
            In the process, setting a good example for my children in learning, 
            as well as not being afraid of getting out of your comfort zone.
            I have never been someone who know much about technology particularly computer science. 
            I think having the knowledge of full stack web development can be useful in many fields.
            Once I finished this course, I would like to be able to keep practising my skills and enjoy using it.
            One of the area I have been considering is digital health. I am researching the scopes for this area.
            I would like to be in a role where I could contribute into a community.
          </p>

        <h2>Strengths and limitations in learning</h2>
          <p class="black-text">
            My strengths are ability to reflect and learn from mistakes, problem-solving skills, analytic skills, team work, determination and perseverance.
            Skills I am trying to improve are describing, creative thinking, not overly self critical and adopting the "not yet" attitude. 
          </p>
          
        <h2>Core human skills</h2>
          <p class="black-text">
            I would like to develop my public speaking skills, listening with intention and be more observance and present. 
          </p>

        <h2>Commitment in the programme</h2>
          <p class="black-text">
            I have readjust my commitments outside of the programme to fit around the course. I am committed so I will take the time required to reach my goals.
            I have plan to do this by setting daily goals. Reflect and revise my goals at the end of the day. 
            Taking daily frequent short break and plan for a long break. 
            Plan for something social and relaxing at the end of the week as an incentive and to celebrate. Mentorship with at least 2 people. 
            Referring back to the process and framework of programming problem solving document until it is a habit and the learning objectives at least three times a day. 
            Getting comfortable in asking for help from facilitation team and other learners before the pressure builds up.
          </p>

        <h2>My expectations from the facilitation team</h2>
          <p class="black-text">
            Be present, kind, individualised help, checking in and feedback.
          </p>

        <h2>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h2>
          <p class="black-text">
            Staying on top of the material would be a challenge. 
            I need more practice speaking in front of group. 
            I think it will be challenging given I do not feel confident with the material.
            Focus will become an issue if I feel overwhelmed. 
            I will be mindful of asking for help early and taking breaks away from the screen.
          </p>

        <h2>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
          <p class="black-text">
            Pairing with others and not feel conscious about my ability. Giving mindful feedback. Public speaking.
          </p>

        <h2>Expectations of yourself and from Bootcamp</h2>
          <p class="black-text">
            Writing down questions I have to research and asking guidance from facilitators.
            Making sure I have enough sleep, take breaks away from screen and getting outside.
            Review my learning and daily goals. 
            I would like to see more mentorship from the bootcamp team.
