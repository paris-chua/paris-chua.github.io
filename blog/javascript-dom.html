        <h2>JavaScript relationship with HTML and CSS</h2>
          <p class="black-text">Building web application is like making an interactive children book.
              The author is the HTML, who provide the content and structure of the story, 
              The illustrator is the CSS, who provide the styling including color, sizing of the pictures, the layout of the pages.
              JavaScript is the modern technologies that make the book comes alive, 
              be it opening of a page or touch of a button on a page of the book.

        <h2>Document Object Model, the DOM</h2>
          <p class="black-text">
            DOM provides an interface on a browser for web developers to use JavaScript to interact with other documents such as HTML.
            In the DOM, every HTML element is represented as objects. Web developers could then use programming language such as 
            JavaScript to access any elements in order to modify or create elements on a browser. 
            These codes could either be written in the HTML file or a link to a seperate JavaScript file within the 'script' tags.</p>
          <p class="black-text">
            Example in this font color change of h1 with id of "header" from black to red 
            (you just have to trust me on this, I'm still learning and don't know how to give you an interactive example).

        <h2>Control Flow and Loops</h2>
          <p class="black-text">Loops are set of conditions given to the computer so task could be repeated to a set number of times with a stop condition. 

          <p class="black-text">This is like washing dishes the old fashion way after a meal!!</p>

            <ol>The dishes loop
              <li>put the sink plug on</li>
              <li>turn on the hot tap</li>
              <li>squirt in the dishwashing liquid</li>
              <li>wash the dishes</li>
              <li>stop washing the dishes when all dishes are done</li>
            </ol>    
          
          For (let i= prepare the sink; i >= one dish to be washed; i=stop when all dishes are washed)

        <h2>Arrays and Objects</h2>
        <p class="black-text">
          An array is a variable that could hold more than one value.
          An object could also be a variable that could hold more than one value (aka member).
          This member is a data type with name (key) and value/ values pair called property.
          
          Accessing data from them requires different structure of statements or syntax.
          For an array, we uses number (index) to access its data. First item in an array is indexed as zero.
          For example,
        </p>

        <p class="black-text">
          For an object, we uses name or key to access its data. For example,
        </p>

        <h2>Functions and why they are helpful</h2>
          <p class="black-text">JavaScript function is a block of codes written to execute a particular task. 
            Functions are helpful because they could be used repeatedly when called upon using different arguments. For examples,
            <img src="../images/JS function example 1-1.png" alt="image of an example of function" width="70%">
            <img src="../images/JS function example 1-2.png" alt="another image of an example of function" width="70%">
