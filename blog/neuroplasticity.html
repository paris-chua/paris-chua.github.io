      <h2>Neuroplasticity and learning</h2>
        <p class="black-text">
          The brain plasticity, as the term indicates, is moldable.
          I think of neuroplasticity as the ability to shape our brain by training our brain "muscle" aka neurons 
          to strengthen the communication between them and the rest of the neural system.
          Just like we need to nurture seedlings into trees, we need to practice and intentionally process our learning  
          so that radicle could become taproot, and develop other rootlets. 
          So that our memory in learning is permanent like a big tree.
        </p>

          I'm definitely putting the principles of neuroplasticity to use in EDV Foundations. Cultivating my seedlings of coding,
          extending the use of my computer and the web outside of emailing, calender and Microsoft Word.
          I've also finally practising meditation daily, this helps me relax and be able to focus better. 
          I am practicing coding everyday and reviewing what I've learnt throughout the process, especially at the end of the day. 
          It is tricky when I am feeling strapped for time. I am also aware that I have to be kind to myself.

      <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>
        <p class="black-text">
          I've first encountered growth mindset 2 years ago from my children's school. Growth mindset is the opposite of fixed mindset. 
          In which, fixed mindset, is of the idea that intelligence as a fixed trait or heavily geared towards natural talents in learning.
          I think our traditional education and our societies' perception of success has a lot to blame in cultivating fixed mindset. 
          Having growth mindset is important aid in increasing our neuroplasticity.
        </p>
        <p class="black-text">
          For me, growth mindset is viewing learning as a process to improve rather than to an end point. 
          It is about not being afraid to ask what I think is a dumb question. To listen and process carefully feedbacks from others. 
          Give careful and useful feedbacks to others, to help them and myself to adopt growth mindset in our learning.
