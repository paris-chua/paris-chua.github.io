      <h1>Identity, Values and Strengths</h1>

      <h2>Values and identity</h2>
        <p>One of the neighbours I occasionally socialise with is getting some landscaping work done along the boundary. 
I am also getting planting along my driveway by the same landscaping company at the same time. 
I found out as work started on their fence that they were putting a gate opening into my driveway without prior discussion. 
Installing the gate makes me feel oblige to change my planting plan to give them access onto my driveway. 
Because I know them as more than neighbours and would like to help them, I decided to let it ride. 
Open communication is important and I think I can always improve on this skill. I thought this could be better communicated beforehand. 
This would not have change their plan but it would let us put some caveats with regards to the use of the gate currently and in the future if or when they move from that property. 
This caused me some anxiety having to bring this up with them. I did and it was all settled without affecting our relationship. 
As it turned out they thought they did mention to me about getting access onto my driveway but my understanding at the time was a temporary access. 
I value my relationship with them and it's important to build connection in your community. 
Being kind and grateful often help me through tricky situation in life.
        </p>

      <h2>Working with others</h2>
        <p>When I was back in university studying for a postgraduate diploma, we were often need to work in group project.
I took the initiative of suggesting a suitable time for everyone to meet. I had to change one of the meeting time because of childcare.
When we met, one of the group member lashed out at me in the public place we were having the meeting for changing the time.
Eventhough I was upset being yelled at, I calmly apologise and said I did not know the change of time was an issue for her.
I talked to the others in the group if I could have communicated about the change of time better. 
I appraoched our lecturer after and asked her advice of how to move forward with the group work. We subsequently find out this student pulled out of the programme.
On reflection, I could be more observance and more direct about asking more direct questions rather than making assumptions in my communication.
Buidling a good relationship, open communication, kindess and gratitude are some of my values to help guide me through life.
        </p>
        <p>Perseverance and determination helped me through my learning. I am proud of my academic achievements, my persistence despite of obstacles. 
What I want to improve is to look into myself more often and to help others to do that often through their life.
My friends say I am generous, reliable and has good humour. I hope I do not stop there and keep improving.
        </p>

      <h2>Culture and identity</h2>
        <p>Culture has definitely influence my values and identity over the years. 
I grew up as a minority group in Malaysia, and one of the children and grand-children of immigrants from China. 
I was brought up to have constant reminder from my parents the importance of academic education as a way of better your life. 
And that nothing else is more valuable than academic achievements. My parents did not finish primary schooling and not all my siblings finish highschool.
Only one other siblings of mine went through tertiary study. This is partly due to my parent values and my family financial situation at the time.
I think my upbringing and the opportunity to go overseas for study is where I cultivate my value of gratitude and perseverance.
